## üíª Setup and Installation

### Requirements

-   **Packages:**
    -   `pandas`
    -   `numpy`
    -   `nltk`
    -   `scikit-learn`
    -   `tensorflow`
    -   `transformers`
    -   `torch`
    -   `pickle` and `re` (built-in libraries)

### Installation

1.  **Install the necessary packages** using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn tensorflow transformers torch
    ```
2.  **Download NLTK data** by running the following Python code once:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    ```
3.  **Place the datasets** in the working directory:
    -   `IMDB Dataset.csv` (raw data)
    -   `reviews.pkl` (pre-processed data, generated by the first notebook)

## üìù File Descriptions

### `Text_Processing.ipynb`

This notebook handles the data cleaning and preparation of the raw IMDB reviews. The steps include:
-   Lowercasing text
-   Removing HTML tags, URLs, email addresses, and punctuation
-   Removing common English stopwords
-   Lemmatizing words to their base form
The output of this notebook is the `reviews.pkl` file, which is a pre-processed DataFrame.

### `Machine_Learning_Model_for_Sentiment_Classification.ipynb`

This notebook trains a traditional machine learning model for sentiment classification. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to represent the text data and a **logistic regression** model for classification. It relies on the `reviews.pkl` file as its input data. The output includes model accuracy and a classification report.

### `LSTM_Model_for_Sentiment_Classification.ipynb`

This notebook implements a deep learning approach using an **LSTM neural network**. It builds and evaluates models on both the raw (`IMDB Dataset.csv`) and pre-processed (`reviews.pkl`) datasets to compare their performance. The notebook also sets random seeds for reproducibility.

### `GPT_2_Classification_using_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates sentiment classification using a pre-trained **GPT-2 model** from Hugging Face. It leverages **prompt engineering** to classify reviews as Positive or Negative. An active internet connection is required to download the model on the first run. You can adjust the number of "shots" (examples) provided to the model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

-   **Data Skipping:** The text preprocessing code is designed to skip bad lines in the CSV file, ensuring robust execution.
-   **Model Expectations:** The machine learning and LSTM notebooks assume the input DataFrame (`reviews.pkl`) has columns named `review` and `sentiment`. The sentiment labels should be binary (`0` for negative, `1` for positive).
-   **GPU Usage:** For faster training of the LSTM model, a GPU is recommended if available.
